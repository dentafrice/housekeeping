{"body":"# Housekeeping V3\r\n\r\nWelcome to Housekeeping.  Housekeeping is an online radio management app designed to quickly and easily allow you manage all the hassle and ins and outs of an online radio station.\r\n\r\nFor the better part of my younger life I was involved in many online streaming radio stations.  Most using either Shoutcast or Icecast.  I created one of the first released DJ panels called \"Housekeeping\".  Housekeeping's name was influenced by the online game \"Habbo\" in which housed the community I released it upon.\r\n\r\nI've set out for Housekeeping V3 to become an amazing side project.  Whether or not the market is still big enough to devote time to the project, I'm using it to try out some new gems and techniques that I can't do at work.  \r\n\r\nI hope you'll follow me on this journey, and even contribute!","name":"Housekeeping","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
